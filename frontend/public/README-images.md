# Image Setup Instructions

## Circuit Board Background

To complete the hero section setup, you need to:

1. Save the circuit board image you provided as `circuit-bg.jpg` in this `/public` directory
2. The image should be the blue circuit board with binary code and glowing elements
3. The code is already set up to use this image with proper blurring and overlay effects

The hero section will automatically use the image once it's placed in the correct location.

## Image Requirements
- Filename: `circuit-bg.jpg`
- Location: `/frontend/public/circuit-bg.jpg`
- The image will be automatically blurred and have reduced opacity for better text readability
